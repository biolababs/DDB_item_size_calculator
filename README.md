It calculates the size in bytes of a DynamoDB item, taking into account various data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries (maps). It also provides functions to determine the required Read Capacity Units (RCUs) and Write Capacity Units (WCUs) based on the item size, as well as a function to check if the item size is under the 400 KB limit.

Documentation:

    size_in_bytes(item): Calculates the size in bytes of the given DynamoDB item. It iterates over the keys and values of the item and recursively calculates the size of each attribute.
    attribute_size_bytes(attribute): Calculates the size in bytes of a single attribute value based on its data type (string, number, bytes, boolean, list, or dictionary).
    number_size_bytes(number_str): Calculates the size in bytes of a number represented as a string. It handles the specific encoding used by DynamoDB for numbers.
    measure(number_str): Helper function used by number_size_bytes to calculate the size of a number string after removing leading and trailing zeros.
    calculate_size(item): Calculates the size in bytes, required RCUs, and required WCUs for the given DynamoDB item.
    is_under_limit(item): Checks if the size of the given DynamoDB item is under the 400 KB limit.

Note that this Python code assumes the use of the decimal module for precise number handling and the base64 module for encoding and decoding binary data. Additionally, it raises a ValueError if an unknown data type is encountered, ensuring that the input data conforms to the expected DynamoDB JSON or Native JSON format.
